# Fanatec-CDL-DD-Table-Mount-Wedge
A 3D printed wedge block for the Fanatec CSL-DD to make mounting to a table top easy


Here are the files that you can use to get a wedge mounting block printed on a 3D printer for the Fanatec CSL-DD.  Attached are:

1) Freecad source files that I used to create the diagram.
2) An exported STL file you can put into Cura to generate g-code.

The holes for mounting the wedge to the base of the CSL-DD are 6mm x 20, but you should verify the length required.
The holes for mounting the wedge to the table top are 8mm bolts with hex heads.  Length will vary on your table top thickness.

If you are going to mount on top of a racing rig, then use the Freecad source files and modify mounting hole locations and size.

I maybe willing to make modifications that are useful to others.  Find me on Busters Corner group on Facebook and start a discussion.
